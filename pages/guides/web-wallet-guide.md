# **Getting Started with Your BitCanna WebWallet** 

### Introduction
The BitCanna WebWallet is a user-friendly browser wallet designed to work seamlessly with multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up your web wallet using the Keplr browser extension. There are other options available, such as Leap-wallet and Cosmostation, but we'll focus on Keplr for this tutorial. If you prefer a mobile wallet, you can also use the BitCanna mobile WeedWallet - check out the [guide here](mobile-wallet-guide).

### Important: Wallet Security
Before we begin, please note that you are the sole owner of your wallet. BitCanna cannot access or recover your wallet or funds. Your wallet can only be recovered using your seed phrase, which is generated during the Keplr account setup process. It's crucial to store your seed phrase in a safe and secure location, as it's the only way to recover your wallet or transfer it to a new device.

### Setting Up Your Keplr Browser Extension
To get started, follow these easy steps:

* **Install and Add the Keplr Browser Extension:** Go to [Keplr's website](https://keplr.app/get) to download and install the Keplr browser extension. Once installed, launch it by clicking on the icon in your browser's extension bar.  
* **Create a New Account:** Choose "Create a new account" and select "Create new recovery phrase". Make sure to save your seed phrase in a secure location. This is the only way to recover your wallet, so don't skip this step.  
* **Verify Your Seed Phrase:** You'll be asked to enter a few words from your seed phrase to ensure you've stored it correctly. Once you've completed this step, enter a descriptive name for your account (only for personal reference) and click "Next" to proceed.  
* **Select Multiple Chains (Optional):** You can select multiple Cosmos-based chains you want to add to your Keplr wallet. This step is optional, but it allows you to manage multiple chains from a single wallet.  
* **Connect to the BitCanna WebWallet:** Head over to the [WebWallet](https://wallet.bitcanna.io) and click on "Keplr browser extension" to access the WebWallet. You may see a pop-up appear (up to two times); click "Approve" to allow the WebWallet to interact with your Keplr browser extension and add BitCanna to your Keplr wallet.  
* **Your New BitCanna Address:** Once connected, you'll find the navigation menu on the left-hand side of the WebWallet. At the top of the menu, you'll see your new, unique BitCanna address. This is where you'll send coins if you want to acquire some.
