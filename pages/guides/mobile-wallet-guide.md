# **Getting Started with Your BitCanna WeedWallet**

### Introduction
The BitCanna WeedWallet is a user-friendly mobile wallet available for download on [Google's PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bitcanna.mobile) and [Apple's AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitcanna-wallet/id6450923268). In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up your WeedWallet and creating a new Bitcanna address. If you prefer to manage your wallet on a laptop or PC, you can also use the BitCanna WebWallet â€“ check out the [guide here](web-wallet-guide).

### Important: Wallet Security
Before we begin, please note that you are the sole owner of your wallet. BitCanna cannot access or recover your wallet or funds. Your wallet can only be recovered using your unique mnemonic phrase, which is generated during the initial setup. It's crucial to store your mnemonic phrase in a safe and secure location, as it's the only way to recover your wallet or transfer it to a new device.

### Setting Up Your BitCanna WeedWallet
To get started, follow these easy steps:

* **Download the mobile wallet:** Head to [Google's PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bitcanna.mobile) or [Apple's AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitcanna-wallet/id6450923268) to download and install the BitCanna WeedWallet. Once installed, launch the app by pressing the icon on your tablet or phone.  
* **Create a password:** When you open the mobile wallet for the first time, you'll be presented with a welcome screen asking you to create a new password. Press ***"Set password"*** and enter a strong password that you can remember. Confirm your password by entering it again, then press ***"Save"*** on the top-right of your screen. You'll return to the home screen, where you can enter your new password and ***"Unlock"*** your wallet.  
* **Create a new BitCanna address:** After unlocking your wallet, you'll be asked to create a new address or import an existing one. In this guide, we'll focus on creating a new address. Press ***"Create one here"*** followed by the green button ***"Create"***.  
* **Save your mnemonic phrase:** You'll be presented with a randomly generated mnemonic phrase. Choose between a 12-word or 24-word phrase. Write down these words and store your phrase in a secure location. This is the only way to recover your wallet, so don't skip this step! Press ***"Start verification"*** to proceed.  
* **Verify your mnemonic phrase:** Put the words in the correct order to verify that you've written down your mnemonic phrase correctly. Press ***"Next step"*** to proceed.  
* **Give your wallet a name:** Finally, give your wallet a name (for personal reference only) and fill in your password. Press ***"Save"*** to complete the process.

### Your New BitCanna Address
Press ***"Dashboard"*** at the bottom of your screen to return to the home screen. Here, you'll see your new, unique BitCanna address. This is where you'll send coins if you want to acquire some.
