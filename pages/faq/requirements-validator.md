# What are the requirements to become a validator?

* Proficient knowledge of working with command lines.
* A minimum of roughly 2 BCNA to submit your validator to the network (create-validator and self-delegate TX)
*   Within the BitCanna network, a maximum amount of 100 validators can be actively signing blocks and therefore earn rewards. These validators are chosen based on their [voting power](/pages/concepts-terms/validators-and-delegators.md#voting-power). The 100 validators with the most voting power will be able to earn rewards. So in other words, you will most likely need a decent amount of [delegations](/pages/concepts-terms/validators-and-delegators.md#delegators) or self-delegated stake.

    **Hardware requirements**
* Linux VPS with 8GB RAM, 4vCPU's, 200 GB disk space per year for Mainnet (the more resources the better)\
