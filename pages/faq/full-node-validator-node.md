# What is a full node/validator node?

A full node is a machine/computer that runs with the chain 100% synced. This means that it has to be running at any time.&#x20;

A validator node is a machine/computer operating in a (delegated) Proof of Stake consensus system. Once it is set up it will compete with other validator nodes for a chance to sign blocks. Doing so will grant the validator rewards.&#x20;
