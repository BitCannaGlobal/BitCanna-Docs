# Chain Parameters

### **Inflation**

* Inflation initial = 2.8% per year
* Inflation minimum = 2.8%
* Inflation maximum = 10%
* Inflation change rate = 10%
* Bonded goal = 67%

Inflation is infinite until decided otherwise by on-chain governance. This means that the larger your stake is in the BitCanna network, the more say you have in changing the chain parameters by voting. This is a big change in regards to our previous network; 420M is practically no longer the MAX supply, but theoretically could be as a result of on-chain voting.
