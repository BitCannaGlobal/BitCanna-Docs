## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. This data is gathered in the logs of the servers used to host the Service. Usage Data may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version and the time and date of Your visit.

When You access the Service by or through a mobile device, We may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device You use, Your mobile device unique ID, the IP address of Your mobile device, Your mobile operating system and the type of mobile Internet browser You use.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
We take all reasonably possible steps to ensure that Your Personal Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and that no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to another organization or another country unless there are adequate controls in place for private and secure handling of Your Personal Data.

The Usage Data and Communication Data are stored on servers that are located in the EEA. These servers are hosted by EU companies. However: please note that these EU companies have parent companies in the USA.

The USA have certain provisions in law that afford their investigative authorities a right to access data that is processed by USA-based companies or their subsidiaries, even if such data is processed outside the USA. One such provision is Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ("FISA", Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law that regulates foreign intelligence and counterintelligence of the United States). Another relevant provision is the so-called "Cloud Act" (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act), which applies specifically to USA-based companies in the telecommunications sector and "remote computing services" (which includes cloud hosting providers).

Following [**the adequacy decision taken by the European Commission in July 2023**](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip\_23\_3721) it is allowed to use Google Analytics in combination with meeting the requirements set forth by the GDPR.

If You find it important to take 0% chance that Your encrypted Usage Data might be accessed by USA government agencies, we must advise You to not use Our Service.

### Your rights regarding Your Personal Data
You have the right to ask us for an overview of the Personal Data that we process about You (“right of access”). Please note that the Usage Data that we process is only subject to data protection rules because this data could theoretically be traced back to individuals, if we were to combine it with additional information gathered elsewhere. In our normal course of business, we do not actually do this, so we generally cannot trace Usage Data back to You. If You use Your right of access, we will show You the Personal Data that we can connect to You without actively gathering additional information.

For Personal Data that we process on the basis of Your consent, You have the right to withdraw Your consent at any time. Withdrawing Your consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on Your consent before its withdrawal.

For Personal Data that we process on the basis of a legitimate interest, You have the right to object on grounds relating to Your particular situation.

We do our solid best to only process Personal Data that is correct, and only when it is necessary and lawful. Should it ever turn out that Personal Data we process about You is incorrect or unlawful for us to process, then You have the right to have Your Personal Data rectified or erased, or have its processing restricted.

You can invoke any of these rights by sending us an email through: info@bitcanna.io

Please note that we may have to ask You certain control questions or request that You provide identification, when You invoke a right regarding Personal Data. We have to be able to authenticate You as the data subject.

If You are unhappy with the way we are processing Your Personal Data or the way we handled a request to exercise Your rights, please tell us, so we can try to resolve the issue. If we are unable to resolve it, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands: [https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en)

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

### Security
The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Links to Other Websites
Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.
